UADE - Unix Amiga Delitracker Emulator
======================================

UADE is a music player for UNIX platforms that plays music formats used on
the Amiga computer.

Very short instructions for installing UADE
===========================================

1. Read INSTALL.readme
2. Install the program globally or directly to your home directory. Do either
	./configure
   or
	./configure --user  (makes uade to be installed under ~/.uade)
3. make
4. make install (as root if installed globally, but as the user if configure
   was given --user)

The program is ready now.

Now you can edit uade.conf, if you want. uade.conf is located at
$PREFIX/share/uade/uade.conf or optionally at ~/.uade/uade.conf.

$ uade123 -zr /my/chips
